# Get center and zoom as float from bounding box

## Run

In `index.js` in line `L.mapbox.accessToken = 'your_token';` insert your token from https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/.

Open index.html in the web browser.

In the console you should see zoom calculated as float.

## Source code included

I have included source code of shpericalmercator and geo-viewport because importing as `<script>` did not work.
